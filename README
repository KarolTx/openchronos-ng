fork of the openchronos-ng that implements interfacing with intertechno radio switches

line 1 of the 'inter' menu option consists of

    FF.DD

    where
        FF - family [1-16]
        DD - device [1-16]

the buttons are as follows:

  button up                - sends a power on signal
  button down              - sends a power off signal
  button #                 - enters config mode

in config mode:
  button up    - sets the next higher value
  button down  - sets the next lower value
  button *     - saves and exits config mode
  button #     - cycles between family and device

== Status ==
In progress..

This is a major rework of the entire system. For now, only this is working:
* clock (based on hardware time keeping, no more inaccuracy).
* alarm (also based on hardware).
* RFBSL wireless update.

It might not look a lot and it isn't because most of the work was done in the
core openchronos. Basically, at core level, this was what has been done:
* Implementation of a system wide message bus.
* Implementation of a RTC driver (for clock and alarm).
* Rework of timer and ports drivers.
* Implementation of a module system (drop in applications).
* Rework of the display routines.
* Rework of the menu system.

In summary, you should expect the code to be more stable, smaller and easier
to understand.

== Requirements ==

* msp430 toolchain (DO NOT USE msp430-gcc4, IT IS DEPRECATED)
* python

== Recommended Toolchain ==

gcc-4.4.3
