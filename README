openchronos-ng - http://openchronos-ng.sourceforge.net

Modular opensource firmware for the TI eZ430 Chronos.
Please check our homepage for the most up to date information.

== Boot Menu & RFBSL (flashing over RF) ==
In openchronos-ng, the watch no longer boots directly into the
main menu anymore. When the watch is reset (or you put the battery
for the first time), you have the choice to either enter flash mode
(press # button) or continue into main menu (press any other button).

== Recommended Toolchain ==

We recommend you to use the following versions for your toolchain,
since certain version combinations can result in buggy code!

msp430-binutils-2.22_p20120911
msp430-gcc-4.6.3_p20120406
msp430-libc-20120716
msp430mcu-20120716

and for debugging:
msp430-gdb-7.2_p20111205
mspdebug-0.21

 Requirements:

   msp430 toolchain
   python-2.7

 Usage:

 Line1 contains FF.DD

 FF is the decimal notation of the family in which the device is placed [1-16]
                  A is 01, B is 02 ... P is 16.
                  this option must be used for doorbell/PIR device selection
 DD is the decimal notation of the device number [1-16]
                  on some factory remotes devices are placed in 4 groups,
                  in this case device 2 from group 3 is device number 10.
                  special devices like doorbell/PIRs must be set as device number 8.

 Line2 becomes 'on', 'off', 'spe' depending on what command was sent last

  if compile time option CONFIG_MOD_INTERTECHNO_PW is set then the output power is 
 selectable on Line2.

 radio glyphs come up when the command is sent.

 buttons:

 up      - send an 'on' command to the current device
 down    - send an 'off' command
 #       - send a special command (for doorbells/PIRs), make sure DD is 8 in this case.
 long *  - enter config mode. use up, down, # to select family and device, * to save.
